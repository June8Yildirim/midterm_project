                        The Uchiha Clan is known for their distinct red eyes, the Sharingan and its stronger Mangekyo form. The Sharingan enhances the visual perception of the user, as well as allow them to copy their opponent's jutsu. That gives them the upper hand in both
                        defense and offense. Beyond the Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan grants the user even more power such as Amaterasu, Susanoo, and Tsukuyomi. Of the Uchiha Clan, its most prominent members are Madara, Itachi, and Sasuke. Madara
                        nearly conquered the entire shinobi world with his Double Rinnegan and Infinite Tsukuyomi, Itachi murdered the majority of the Uchiha Clan with his Mangekyo, and Sasuke earned himself a Rinnegan from the Sage of Six Paths to take
                        down the destructive Kaguya OTsutsuki by teaming up with Naruto.

                        Once a feared clan of Uzushiogakure for their immense chakra power, the Uzumaki were forced into disbandment after the destruction of their village. Scattered across the ninja world, the survivors of the Uzumaki grew up in different environments under
                        different circumstances. Naruto's mother, Kushina, moved to Konohagakure and was the designated jinchuriki of the Nine-Tails prior to Naruto's birth due to her special Uzumaki chakra. Because both of Naruto's parents were killed
                        when the Nine-Tails attacked the village, he was forced to grow up alone as an orphan but still had enough strength and perseverance to eventually become Hokage. Other notable members of the Uzumaki Clan are Nagato, who nearly
                        destroyed all of Konohagakure with his Rinnegan and Six Paths of Pain, and Karin, who aided rogue Sasuke with her huge chakra reserves.

                        The Kazekage Clan consists of the Sand Siblings, Gaara, Temari, and Kankuro, and their parents. Though their official family name is not known, "Kazekage" signifies the leadership position held by both Gaara and his father, Rasa, in Sunagakure. Rasa,
                        the Fourth Kazekage, was known for using gold dust with his magnet style kekkei genkai, as well as going toe-to-toe with the One-Tailed Beast, Shukaku. Gaara, the youngest kage ever, is not only the jinchuriki of Shukaku but also
                        very skilled with his superb sand manipulation. Temari excels in wind jutsu with her iconic giant fan, while Kakuro wields a variety of puppets with chakra threads.

                        The Hyuga Clan are most prominently known for their unique pupil-less eyes, the Byakugan. The Byakugan is not only a kekkei genkai but also one of the strongest eyes out there along with the Rinnegan and Sharingan. Due to their Byakugan and connection
                        to the Otsutsuki Clan, the Hyuga Clan is one of power, nobility, and secrets. Their most well-known technique is the Gentle Fist style of taijutsu, which utilizes their Byakugan to see and strike their opponent's chakra points
                        to hinder their access to chakra. They also have more sacred techniques such as the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms that is usually only passed down through the main house, though the genius Neji was able to master it on his own.

                        The Sarutobi Clan has well-established traditions and history in Konohagakure. They have a strong sense of virtue and are responsible for maintaining an unbreakable bond between the clans of the Ino-Shika-Cho trio. From generation to generation, the Sarutobis
                        continue to prosper and fight to protect their village. The Third Hokage, also known as Hiruzen Sarutobi, possessed both a kind heart and extraordinary ninja skills such as summoning the Shinigami with the sacred Dead Demon Consuming
                        Seal. Even after his death, the Sarutobi Clan lives on with other elite ninja and future prospects in Asuma (until his own death a few years after), Konohamaru, and Mirai.

                    <p class="clanSpecialities">
                        Team Seven's leader, Kakashi, and his father, Sakumo, are the only two known members of the Hatake Clan. However, those two ninja alone are enough to make their clan one of the strongest. As one of the most prevalent characters throughout the entire Naruto
                        series, Kakashi has proven time after time why he was worthy of becoming the Sixth Hokage. He took advantage of the Sharingan eye gifted from his friend, Obito, and was able to copy and learn countless jutsu from his opponents.
                        Like his son, Sakumo was also a gifted shinobi known as the "White Fang" due to the White Light Chakra Sabre he used for battle.

                    <p class="clanSpecialities">
                        The Nara clan is known for two things: strategic minds and manipulation of shadows. Shikamaru Nara and his father Shikaku are two of the smartest minds to ever live in Konohagakure. Their ability to strategize and use their family abilities are the stuff
                        of legend. Shikamaru is even able to take on members of the Akatsuki on his own, not a feat many other teenage shinobi manage. It takes immense control and focus to use their shadows against their opponents as well.

                    <p class="clanSpecialities">
                        The Yamanaka clan makes up one-third of the traditional Ino-Shika-Cho trio. While the “Shika” and “Cho” parts of the trio are more about physical abilities, using shadows and strength to manipulate opponents, the “Ino” part of the trio uses their mind.
                        The Yamanaka clan is able to use their minds to control their opponents, to communicate telepathically, and more. They might not be as physically strong as their teammates, but mentally, they’re some of the toughest shinobi to
                        beat.

                        Like Kiba representing the Inuzukas, fans mostly get a taste of this clan through one particular character. Shino Aburame is actually on the same team as Kiba when they’re growing up as they fight alongside Hinata Hyuga, making their team one with incredibly
                        specific abilities. The Aburames are a clan that works with insects. They don’t just learn to control them to help with their jutsu. Instead, the Aburames have created a symbiotic relationship with certain species of bugs that
                        allow the bugs to share their chakra. It’s not the prettiest of shinobi abilities, but it’s certainly an interesting one.

                    <p class="clanSpecialities">
                        Fans are most familiar with this clan thanks to the presence of Kiba in the Naruto series. He hasn’t been around much as an adult in Boruto, but his family is known for a very specialized skill. The Inuzukas raise ninja dogs. Their dogs are able to partner
                        with shinobi and perform jutsu on missions. When an Inuzuka is on the team, it’s like having a whole extra set of hands in a fight.

                        The people of Kumogakure can be odd at times (see Killer B, the rapping ninja,) but they are powerful and intense. Not only do they harness lightning, but they also house the violent Eight-Tailed Beast. Their customs are a bit bizarre, naming their children
                        things like A and B, but they are strong protectors. After all, they dedicate themselves to leading and guarding all the people in their land. Fans may never fully understand this unique clan, but they cannot deny their powers.
                        Killer B is one of a very few people who can face off against Naruto. They raise their children resilient and fearless, in battle or while performing.

                        While the Hurano family isn't exactly a big clan, the members of its family are too important not to mention. Both Kizashi and his daughter Sakura are powerful ninja that make great contributions to Konoha. In another life, Kizashi could have become Hokage.
                        Meanwhile, Sakura became one of the strongest medical-nin to ever exist, between her own chakra prowess and her teachings from Tsunade. Furthermore, though her daughter classifies as an Uchiha, Sakura did raise an immensely powerful
                        and intelligent ninja. Sarada doesn't just impress because of her Uchiha blood, but also because of her Hurano discipline and intelligence. Though the group doesn't have many members, the Hurano line created enough of an impact
                        to earn rank as a powerful clan.

            <p>What is Naruto?</p>
            <p>
                Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by Masashi Kishimoto. It was first published as a manga, in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in November, 1999. Since then, it has gone on to be one of the most successful and popular manga
                series in Japan and around the world. An anime adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on TV Tokyo, on October 3, 2002. A total of 220 episodes were made (though many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely
                popular and enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled "Naruto Shippuden", has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by Masashi Kishimoto.
