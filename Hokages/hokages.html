            The Kage Position and History

        <p>
            Kage is a title reserved for the leader of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries' hidden villages, Hidden Leaf Village, Hidden Sand Village, Hidden Mist Village, Hidden Cloud Village, and the Hidden stone Village. They are mainly known as the Five Kage
            (Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage, Tsuchikage). How a Kage is appointed is different for each village. If the kage dies or is otherwise incapacitated before they can choose a successor, the selection falls to their Land's Feudal Lord who
            is advised by his committee as well as the village's elders. In the whole naruto series there have been a total of twenty-seven Kages. The title was originally created by Hashirama Shenju soon after the formation of Konoha, making him the
            first Kage to exist after being elected by the population of his village and country. After the creation of the position, other nations praised this new system that had been created and soon began to imitate it. This new system mean't that
            the Kage was the village's leader, meaning that most decision making was done by them. They are also tasked with protecting the village at all costs

                Hokage meaning Fire Shadow is the Kage of the Hidden Leaf village located in the land of Fire. The Hokage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in the village. The Hokage is responsible for most of the village's day-to-day affairs, such as assigning
                missions to the village's ninja or securing funding for the village's projects and personnel. The position can become a handfull as you are responsible of protecting the village, with a heavy workload that can be quite formidable. Once
                they assume the duties of Hokage, their face is carved into the Hokage Rock. In total there have been Seven Hokage's.

                have earned a reputation for being feared and respected around the world, yet also has a reputation of being considered cursed, as all Kazekage including the current had met death at the hands of assassins. Each kazakage is made a full-body
                statue upon their promotion and is kept within the meeting council. There have been a total of five Kazekage.

                their own governement mainly marked by strong secrecy, strict internal polotics and limited interactions with other villages. All that changed after the reign of the Fifth Mizukage.\There have been a total of 6 Mizukage.

                is that three of the four Mizukage were linked by the same family. The Tsuchikage are known for the realisation or true authority, having their shinobi obeying all commands without hesitation. This over time wold give them a bad reputation
                because the Second and Third Tsuchikage would employ unfair tactics such as taking advantage of other alliances, even in peace time. This would end after the Fourth Great Shinobi War. There have been a total of 4 Tsuchikage.

            <p>What is Naruto?</p>
            <p>
                Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by Masashi Kishimoto. It was first published as a manga, in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in November, 1999. Since then, it has gone on to be one of the most successful and popular manga
                series in Japan and around the world. An anime adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on TV Tokyo, on October 3, 2002. A total of 220 episodes were made (though many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely
                popular and enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled "Naruto Shippuden", has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by Masashi Kishimoto.
