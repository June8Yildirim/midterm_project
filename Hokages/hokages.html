            <strong>Kage</strong> is a title reserved for the leader of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries' hidden villages, Hidden Leaf Village, Hidden Sand Village, Hidden Mist Village, Hidden Cloud Village, and the Hidden stone Village. They are
            mainly known as the Five Kage (<strong>Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage, Tsuchikage</strong>). How a Kage is appointed is different for each village. If the kage dies or is otherwise incapacitated before they can choose a successor, the
            selection falls to their Land's Feudal Lord who is advised by his committee as well as the village's elders. In the whole naruto series there have been a total of twenty-seven Kages. The title was originally created by Hashirama Shenju soon
            after the formation of Konoha, making him the first Kage to exist after being elected by the population of his village and country. After the creation of the position, other nations praised this new system that had been created and soon began
            to imitate it. This new system mean't that the Kage was the village's leader, meaning that most decision making was done by them. They are also tasked with protecting the village at all costs

            <strong>Hokage</strong> meaning (Fire Shadow) is the Kage of the Hidden Leaf village located in the land of Fire. The Hokage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in the village. The Hokage is responsible for most of the village's
            day-to-day affairs, such as assigning missions to the village's ninja or securing funding for the village's projects and personnel. The position can become a handfull as you are responsible of protecting the village, with a heavy workload
            that can be quite formidable. Once they assume the duties of Hokage, their face is carved into the Hokage Rock. In total there have been Seven Hokage's, first being <strong>Hashirama Senju</strong>, second
            <strong>Tobirama Senju </strong>, third <strong>Hiruzen Sarutobi</strong>, fourth <strong>Minato
                Namikaze</strong>, fifth

            <strong>Kazekage</strong> meaning (Wind Shadow) is the kage of the Hidden Sand Village located in the land of Wind, a title on the village's leader. He is usually regarded as the strongest shinobi in the village. The Kazekage position was
            created after the formation of the village by Reto, the village's founder. In the anime it is not clearly stated how the position is earned but it suggests is that the Kazekage position is heriditary, or at least after the fourth Kazekage.
            throughout history, the Kazekage have earned a reputation for being feared and respected around the world, yet also has a reputation of being considered cursed, as all Kazekage including the current had met death at the hands of assassins.
            Each kazakage is made a full-body statue upon their promotion and is kept within the meeting council. There have been a total of five Kazekage's, first being <strong>Reto</strong>, second <strong>Shamon</strong>, third name unknown, fourth
            <strong>Rasa</strong>, and the fifth <strong>Gaara</strong>.

            is earned by the strongesst person in the village, regardless of considerations such as age. Throughout the years the Mizukage had influence in all political and military issues that arise in relation to the village and its inhabitants, with
            each of the four leaders having their own governement mainly marked by strong secrecy, strict internal polotics and limited interactions with other villages. All that changed after the reign of the Fifth Mizukage. There have been a total of
            6 Mizukage's, the first being <strong>Byakuren</strong>, second <strong>Gengetsu Hozuki</strong>, third name unknown, fourth <strong>Yagura Karatachi</strong>, fiften <strong>Mei Terumi</strong>, and the sixth

            for his long service and detication as the bodyguard of the first Raikage. After the third died his son enherited it. The position is known for its desire to protect the village and its inhabitants as well as for its pride. Throughout the
            history of the village, the first four Raikage each had the given name A, eaxh A had a tag-team partner named B who was responsible for defending the Raikage. There have been a toatal of 5 Raikage's, first being

            is not clear, but what is shown is that three of the four Mizukage were linked by the same family. The Tsuchikage are known for the realisation or true authority, having their shinobi obeying all commands without hesitation. This over time
            wold give them a bad reputation because the Second and Third Tsuchikage would employ unfair tactics such as taking advantage of other alliances, even in peace time. This would end after the Fourth Great Shinobi War. There have been a total
            of 4 Tsuchikage's, the first being <strong>Ishikawa</strong>, second <strong>Mu</strong>, third

                <span>What is Naruto?</span> <br /> Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by <em> Masashi
                    Kishimoto</em>. It was first published as a manga, in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in
                <u> November, 1999</u>. Since then, it has gone on to be one of the <b> most successful</b> and popular manga series in Japan and around the world. An anime adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on <span>TV Tokyo, on
                    October 3, 2002</span> . A total of <strong>220</strong> episodes were made (though many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely popular and enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled &quot; Naruto Shippuden&quot;,
                has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by Masashi Kishimoto.
