        <strong>Kage</strong> is a title reserved for the leader of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries' hidden villages, Hidden Leaf Village, Hidden Sand Village, Hidden Mist Village, Hidden Cloud Village, and the Hidden stone Village. They are mainly known as the Five Kage (<strong>Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage, Tsuchikage</strong>). How a Kage is appointed is different for each village. If the kage dies or is otherwise incapacitated before they can choose a successor, the selection falls to their Land's Feudal Lord who is advised by his committee as well as the village's elders. In the whole naruto series there have been a total of twenty-seven Kages. The title was originally created by Hashirama Shenju soon after the formation of Konoha, making him the first Kage to exist after being elected by the population of his village and country. After the creation of the position, other nations praised this new system that had been created and soon began to imitate it. This new system mean't that the Kage was the village's leader, meaning that most decision making was done by them. They are also tasked with protecting the village at all costs
