            The Akatsuki is a clan that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and led by different individuals. Though each iteration is viewed as either subversives or criminals, all
            seek to make the world a better place through their own means. Each Akatsuki tended to have multiple lairs across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the various security measures that protected them. The Akatsuki consist
            of some of the major antagonists in the Naruto series.

            <h3>Nagato</h3>
            <p>
                Nagato &lpar;known as Pain&rpar; is the leader, and founder of the Akatsuki clan alongside his firends Yahiko and Konan. He is considered as the main antagonist of the Naruto series. He was a shnobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan. As
                a child, he was known for being kind, sensitive and loyal. However, after the death of Yahiko during his adulthood, he became very cruel, aloof and cold man, believing himself a &quot;god of peace&quot; who was to teach the world pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nagato is regarded as the most powerful member, and the second most powerful reincarnated shinobi, second only to an enhanced Madara Uchiha. Upon restoring and rejuvenating his body using the Tailed Beast chakra he absorbed from B, he simultaneously overwhelmed
                and immobilised the Eight and Nine-Tails jinch&#363;riki with ease although his legs remained weakened. Despite his effectiveness being reduced due to Kabuto Yakushi's direct control, it still required a combined effort of Naruto, Killer
                B, and Itachi Uchiha to defeat and seal him. As Pain, he was regarded as unbeatable by various individuals, and his strength allowed him to defeat and kill Hanz&#333;. He was also able to defeat Jiraiya, his former teacher. Not only that,
                he could face the entire village of Konohagakure and destroy it single handily, only losing one of his Paths in the various battles with Konoha ninja. Before he faced Naruto, Nagato had never lost a single battle. <a href="">[]</a>

            <h3>Black Zetsu</h3>
            <p>
                Black Zetsu is the first half of the Zetsu, and a physical manifestation of Princess Kaguya &#332;tsutsuki's will. It secretly instigated many of the events that shaped the shinobi world to secure Kaguya's revival. To further its plans, it posed as Madara
                Uchiha's manifested will and then partnered with White Zetsu to become half of the Akatsuki member known simply as Zetsu. Compare to White Zetsu, Black Zetsu more serious and knowledgable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to its parasitic nature, Black Zetsu has shown many abilities that ultimately aided it in deceiving and manipulating others for centuries, all while remaining hidden and anonymous. With the powers at its disposal and tactical capabilities in combination
                with Kaguya's, the two were able to easily fend off both Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha for a time, despite the two being aided by their respective enhancements and help from their allies. It could also use all five basic nature transformations
                and Yin and Yang Release.

            <h3>Obito Uchiha</h3>
            <p>
                Obito Uchiha was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan, and was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War In actuality, Obito was saved from death from Madara Uchiha, who then helped train Obito, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned
                with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal world. Resurfacing under the name Tobi, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public and starting
                the Fourth Shinobi World War.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a genin, Obito's abilities were average at best, struggling to match his classmates from the Academy. Determined to improve himself, he trained for several months at a time to eventually become a ch&#363;nin. Madara saw great potential in Obito and
                thus selected him as his disciple. Madara's hopes were proven correct, as under his tutelage, Obito dramatically improved his abilities as a late bloomer, with his skills leading to others questioning if he was Madara. As a teenager, Obito
                posed a threat to the Five Great Shinobi Countries, having taken control of the Fourth Mizukage and effectively Kirigakure, as well as posing a challenge to the Fourth Hokage and nearly destroying Konoha. As an adult, he defeated Root's
                most skilled ninja, and simultaneously held his own against Konoha's top shinobi and Killer B. As the Ten-Tails Jinch&#363;riki, Obito's power exceeded that of even Hashirama Senju, he was able to effortlessly fight three powerful Hokage
                with ease, overwhelm both Naruto and Sasuke Uchiha several times, and had the capability to destroy the entire Allied Shinobi Forces.

            <h3>Itachi Uchiha</h3>
            <p>
                Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan, but later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent
                conflict with Konoha and its ninja.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent, consistently showing prowess well-beyond his years, effortlessly learning new techniques from simple observation, and rising rapidly through the ninja ranks. His prowess
                rivalled Shisui Uchiha, who was well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time. He was highly proficient in all three main ninja skill sets and gained praise from allies and foes alike; Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly admitted
                Itachi was stronger than he was. Obito revealed that despite being weakened from illness and Sasuke having absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their battle if he wanted to. Even when restraining himself,
                a team of j&#333;nin were still pushed to their limits against Itachi.

            <h3>Konan</h3>
            <p>
                Konan was a kunoichi from Amegakure and a founding member of the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death, she was partnered with Nagato, who had since taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only member to call him by his name.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an S-rank criminal who grew up in war-torn times and being personally trained under Jiraiya, one of the three legendary Sannin, Konan was undoubtedly a very powerful kunoichi. Her skills were held in high regard by her partner Pain, and has been highly
                praised by her former teacher, Jiraiya. She was also able to nearly kill Obito, with the latter only surviving due to using the kinjutsu Izanagi, something she did not anticipate in her countless simulations of their battle.

            <h3>Kisame Hoshigaki</h3>
            <p>
                Kisame Hoshigaki was a shinobi of Kirigakure's Hoshigaki Clan. After joining the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he became a S-rank missing-nin.
            </p>

                Kisame was an extremely powerful shinobi who earned admittance into the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist and later Akatsuki. He easily killed his former master, a member of the Seven Swordsmen's strongest generation while the man wielded Samehada against
                Kisame. He claimed to be the best Akatsuki member at capturing targets alive, proven when he successfully captured the Four-Tails' jinchūriki Rōshi with little effort. He also overwhelmed Killer B, nearly capturing him while at full strength
                and could battle an entire elite team with diminished strength single-handedly. On separate occasions, Kisame proved to be more than a match for Guy &lpar;one of Konoha's top shinobi&rpar;, forcing the latter to open six of the Eight Gates
                against only a 30% power clone, and seven gates against the real Kisame without his sword. <a href="">[]</a>

            <h3>Sasori</h3>
            <p>
                Sasori was an S-rank missing-nin from Sunagakure's Puppet Brigade and a member of Akatsuki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sasori was a very powerful shinobi, being able to, with effort, defeat and kill the Third Kazekage, the strongest ninja in Suna's history. His use of his puppets was greatly feared throughout the Third Shinobi World War as he turned the sand red with
                blood, giving him the nickname, &quot;Sasori of the Red Sand&quot;. His legacy was such that Kankur&#333; knew of and feared him despite being born after Sasori already left the village. Deidara himself even admitted that Sasori was the
                stronger of the two of them.

            <h3>Deidara</h3>
            <p>
                Deidara was an S-rank missing-nin from Iwagakure. During his time in the village, he was a member of the Explosion Corps. After defecting from the village, he was forced into Akatsuki and was its youngest member.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deidara was a very powerful S-rank missing-nin whose abilities earned him recognition within Akatsuki. Even the organisation's leader, Pain, praised Deidara's abilities, openly admitting that he was something unique, and that his loss was a major blow
                to the group. Deidara was able to single-handedly defeat Gaara &lpar;Shukaku's jinchūriki and the Fifth Kazekage&rpar;, and Isobu, despite fighting the both of them in their home territories. He also fought on equal grounds with Sasuke
                Uchiha, an Uchiha clan prodigy, despite his techniques being at an elemental disadvantage against those of Sasuke. <a href="">[]</a>

            <h3>Hiden</h3>
            <p>
                Hidan was an S-rank missing-nin who defected from Yugakure and later joined the Akatsuki. He was also the second newest member of Akatsuki at the time of Tobi's introduction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hidan is a very powerful shinobi, whose skills lead to Yugakure choosing to not deal with the S-rank missing-nin, as there wasn't a ninja in the village that could take him on. His skills were of a high enough standard to be recruited by Akatsuki, where
                alongside his partner Kakuzu, he defeated the Two-Tails' jinch&#363;riki in her Tailed Beast Mode, as well as Asuma, one of the Konohagakure's top j&#333;nin. <a href="">[]</a>

            <h3>Kakuzu</h3>
            <p>
                Kakuzu was an S-rank missing-nin from Takigakure and a member of Akatsuki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kakuzu was an extremely powerful ninja, earning membership into the S-rank organisation of Akatsuki. During his frequent rages, he killed all but one of his partners in the organisation, due to the latter being immortal. His skills were such that he was
                chosen by his village to assassinate Hashirama Senju, surviving the battle despite failing the mission. Kakuzu's might is such, that had it not been for the interference of Team Yamato, he would have likely killed Team Asuma.

            <p>What is Naruto?</p>
            <p>
                Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by Masashi Kishimoto. It was first published as a manga, in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in November, 1999. Since then, it has gone on to be one of the most successful and popular manga
                series in Japan and around the world. An anime adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on TV Tokyo, on October 3, 2002. A total of 220 episodes were made (though many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely
                popular and enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled "Naruto Shippuden", has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by Masashi Kishimoto.
