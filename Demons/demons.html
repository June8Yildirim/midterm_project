        <h1>Tail Beasts and Their Hosts</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>Stroy of Tail Beasts</h2>
            <p>
                Long before the founding of the hidden villages, the Sage of Six Paths saved the world by sealing the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki. Some time later, the Sage was inspired by his youngest son, Asura, to use his Creation of All Things
                ability to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine living entities, what would become the tailed beasts.[4][5] The Sage named the nine and explained to them that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of
                a day when they would be brought together again — though not as they were — and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is.[6] In the anime, it was shown that before his death, the Sage and his followers built
                temples in nine different regions of the world where the tailed beasts could live and be protected.[7] The tailed beasts were originally created not only to prevent the Ten-Tails' resurrection, but also to maintain and balance peace.[8]
                The first person to come close to their original usage was Hashirama Senju, who had captured several of the tailed beasts with his Wood Release, distributed the beasts amongst the new villages in order to stabilise the balance of power
                between them. However, Hashirama's usage of the tailed beasts were forceful rather than earning their wilful cooperation.[9] This method would be realised in Hashirama's successor as Asura's reincarnation, Naruto Uzumaki.

            </p>
            <p>Over the centuries, humanity failed to recognise the tailed beasts as sentient individuals, instead seeing them only as monsters, demons, or mindless beasts worthy of fear and disdain. Because of their immense power, the tailed beasts were
                sought out by humans to be used as weapons in times of war. The beasts resented this treatment and came to hate humans, at times willingly becoming the monsters they were viewed as.[10] In order to harness the beasts' power, the villages
                began sealing them into humans, creating their own jinchūriki.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tailed beasts sharing their chakra with Naruto. Decades later, after the Third Shinobi World War, an organisation known as Akatsuki begins capturing the villages' jinchūriki in order to extract their tailed beasts and seal them into the Demonic Statue
                of the Outer Path for the purposes of reviving the Ten-Tails. By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Akatsuki has captured the first seven tailed beasts.[11] In order to capture the last two, the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, Tobi
                seals the beasts back into their reincarnated jinchūriki and forces them to fight the Eight-Tails' and Nine-Tails' jinchūriki: Killer B and Naruto Uzumaki, respectively. From Naruto's determination to free them from Tobi and his desire
                to learn their names, the tailed beasts collectively decide that Naruto is the person the Sage of Six Paths foretold of. They give him portions of their chakra, enabling him to release them from Tobi's control.
            </p>
            <figure class="totalBijuus">
                <img src="bijus/bijuus.jpg" alt="All Bijuus">
            </figure>
            <p>
                The tailed beasts reunite with Hagoromo and Naruto. Tobi is able to reclaim the freed tailed beasts and, using fragments of the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails' chakra,[12] to prematurely revive the Ten-Tails.[13] Tobi then becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki,
                but he is defeated by the Allied Shinobi Forces and the tailed beasts are removed from his body.[14] The nine tailed beasts join forces against Tobi's co-conspirator, Madara Uchiha, but he quickly defeats them all and seals them, including
                the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, into the Demonic Statue and reforms the Ten-Tails yet again.[15] Madara becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki and attempts to use Infinite Tsukuyomi on the world. Naruto uses the tailed beasts' earlier donations
                of chakra to try and defeat him, but is unable to do so in time. Madara is afterwards unwittingly used to restore Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, who tries to take what portions of the tailed beasts' chakra Naruto still has. The nine tailed beasts being
                freed from the Ten-Tails. In one of Kaguya's dimensions, Naruto and Sasuke Uchiha seal Kaguya away and the tailed beasts are extracted from her body, ending the war. Sasuke, however, realising that the struggle for the tailed beasts started
                the war in the first place, imprisons them with Chibaku Tensei and intends to kill them so the world can't fight over them any longer. Naruto convinces him not to in the end and the tailed beasts are finally released for good.[16] The
                tailed beasts spread out through the world, free to live as they want; both Gyūki and Kurama decide to return and stay with B and Naruto. However, though they are apart, the tailed beasts' chakra fragments remain within Naruto, allowing
                his body to act as their "meeting ground".[17]
            </p>
            <p>
                Fifteen years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, during the investigation of the Ōtsutsuki clan to find out Kaguya's final fate, two of them began to chase the tailed beasts in order to claim their chakra, starting with Gyūki and Kurama. While Momoshiki
                Ōtsutsuki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki were initially successful in steal an amount of the powers of the respective beasts by capturing their jinchūriki, both ended up being killed by being dominated by the combined power and effort of the Five
                Kage, Sasuke and Boruto Uzumaki.
            </p>
            <p>

                The Tailed beasts in a meeting with Naruto during the threat of the Ōtsutsuki. Sometime after the defeat of Momoshiki and Kinshiki, when Urashiki Ōtsutsuki began targeting Shukaku for its chakra, it was deduced he was also interested in all the tailed
                beasts' chakra. Naruto then organised a telepathic meeting with the other tailed beasts, except for Matatabi, Kokuō, and Chōmei, who each refused to accept aid from humans in fear of being captured and used again by them, despite their
                trust in Naruto, and thus decided to skip the meeting. With the final defeat of Urashiki, the beasts that were being kept safe presumably returned to be free to go their own way.
            </p>
            <h2>Abilities</h2>

            <p>
                The tailed beasts performing their signature technique. Tailed beasts are widely believed to be bestial in nature, incapable of the intelligence needed to fully utilise their immense strength. It is thought that only when sealed within humans are they
                able to benefit from the knowledge of their jinchūriki to use their powers effectively.[18] This is not actually true. However, the Ten-Tails does tend to make wanton use of its powers, not focusing its abilities towards whatever end would
                be most advantageous to it until sealed into a jinchūriki.[19]
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the tailed beasts have their own unique abilities, but they all share the same attributes: they have massive quantities of powerful chakra — coloured red — far greater than what most shinobi have, can easily transfer their chakra to whomever they
                choose,[20] and can use the Tailed Beast Ball.[21] Because the tailed beasts are pure chakra, they cannot actually be killed; if they or their jinchūriki die, their chakra will re-coalesce in time.[22] In addition, if a large portion of
                a tailed beast's chakra is separated from it, that chakra becomes a separate, sentient copy of the tailed beast.[23] It is also pointed out that consuming the flesh of a tailed beast is usually deadly for anyone, unless the person is somehow
                descended from the Sage of Six Paths; in this case, the person will gain abilities similar to a jinchūriki.[24]
            </p>
            <p>
                Tailed beasts can communicate telepathically with one another and their jinchūriki, and possess several levels of consciousness. In the initial level, the beast appears to be in a habitat of sorts, typically imprisoned in some way by whatever fūinjutsu
                was used to seal them.[25][26] The second level is where all the tailed beasts can convene and communicate with one another, free of any restrictions. Jinchūriki are also able to enter this level, but in order to do so, they must be completely
                linked with their tailed beasts.[27] A freed tailed beast can continue communication with their former jinchūriki, even years after separating.[28]
            </p>
            <p>
                Although only shown with Kurama, a tailed beast will become unconscious if they have lost all of their chakra, by either using it, or having it drained from them.[29] It has been shown that Tailed Beasts can have more than one conscience or body, as in
                the Fourth Great Ninja War and onwards, Shukaku to Chōmei are present in the real-world, and Gyūki was inside Killer Bee, while all 8 were inside Naruto as well, where they hold meetings.

            <h3>One-Tail aka Shukaku </h3>
            <h3>Host:
                <a href="../index.html#gaara">Gaara</a>
            </h3>
            <figure class="rightFloat">

                <figcaption> One-Tail</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The only Tailed Beast to be referred to by actual name instead of just referred to by what animal it looks like or its number of tails, at least, up until Chapter 568. According to the (untrue) legends of the Hidden Sand Village, Shukaku was once a man,
                a corrupted monk who was sealed into a tea kettle. It was sealed into Gaara upon his birth by Chiyo on orders from the Fourth Kazekage, using Gaara's mother as a sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Gaara's sullen, morose personality, Shukaku is childish and short-tempered, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner, giving it the demeanor of a drunkard (this fits in with typical depictions of tanuki in Japanese mythology).
                Like all Tailed Beasts, it has an immense blood-lust and hunger for battle and relishes a chance to kill opponents.
            </p>
            <figure class="leftFloat">
                <img src="bijus/oneTail2.png" alt="Shukaku">
                <figcaption> One Tail</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Shukaku has the ability to levitate sand via the Magnet Release (which normally only affects metals such as iron and gold), which allows its host to manipulate it for both offense and defense, doing the latter to automatically protect Gaara (and its previous
                hosts) from all harm. This prevents even self-inflicted injuries — Gaara had never known physical pain before the series. Gaara's famed sand shield is even long thought to be Shukaku's doing until it gets extracted from Gaara yet the latter
                still exhibits his power. Unlike other Tailed Beasts, whose transformations are formed of red chakra, Shukaku's hosts transform by covering themselves in sand. When angry or consumed by bloodlust, Gaara can give himself over to Shukaku,
                allowing the spirit to take its true form. In this form, it is so large that Naruto was forced to summon Gamabunta in order to defeat him. Shukaku is associated with the Wind element.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shukaku manifests itself on Gaara's body by way of dark, raccoon-like circles that appear around his eyes. Deidara is assigned to capture Shukaku. He does so, defeating Gaara and transporting his body to an Akatsuki hideout to extract the spirit. Although
                Shukaku is successfully extracted, resulting in Gaara's death, Chiyo used a forbidden jutsu to repent her old sin and revive Gaara at the cost of her own life. As once stated by Gyūki, Shukaku has a bitter grudge against Kurama, in response
                to judging the power of the Tailed Beasts by the number of tails they have. Kurama, having the most tails, and Shukaku, having only one, causes the fox to view itself as the strongest and the tanuki as the weakest. Ever since Kurama made
                that scathing insult, Shukaku strives to find any opportunity to surpass its arrogant rival. Later, as with Kurama, Shukaku comes to respect humans again, more specifically Gaara.

            <p>
                This Tailed Beast was sealed into Yugito Nii, a kunoichi of the Hidden Cloud Village. It is said to be a spirit of vengeance — the living ghost of a twisted human being. It can breathe fire. Yugito can transform into Matatabi, but this didn't help her
                against Hidan and Kakuzu, who defeated her in a battle with massive collateral damage. (It's unknown which one, specifically, was assigned to capture her.) The spirit was later extracted, and Yugito died from the procedure. Yugito and
                Matatabi returned in the Fourth Shinobi World War Arc alongside the other jinchūriki, brought back to life under the control of Edo Tensei, with the cat resealed inside her. Killer B expressed his distaste when he saw one of his old role
                models being used as a chew toy.</p>

            <p>
                This giant turtle-like monster is the only Tailed Beast seen so far who was not sealed into a host when Akatsuki captured it. However, the Beast has had at least two hosts at one point, Rin Nohara of Konoha, made a jinchūriki in order to destroy Konoha;
                and a young man from the Hidden Mist Village named Yagura Karatachi, who was the Fourth Mizukage. However, Yagura was mind-controlled by Tobi and killed afterward, so the Beast was free by the time it was encountered in the main story.
                A Filler arc was centered around this creature, with the Leaf Ninja trying to seal it, only to be stopped by Guren and her henchmen repeatedly, eventually foiling the mission altogether. As such, the Akatsuki tracked it down, where it
                was easily defeated by Deidara and Tobi, who were assigned to capture it. Tobi claimed to have knocked it out in one punch, although Deidara contests this assertion.

                This Beast, referred as the Four-Tails, was sealed into the body of Rōshi, an elderly man from the Hidden Rock Village. His host was able to manipulate lava, likely a power gained from this beast. Rather than letting its presence cause him scorn and hate,
                Rōshi left his village to try and better understand the beast. However, Rōshi would eventually run into Kisame Hoshigaki of the Akatsuki and engaged in a lengthy battle with the shark ninja. Unfortunately, although he was a very tough
                opponent, Rōshi was defeated, and later died when the Four-Tails was forcibly extracted from his body. Kisame, who was assigned to capture it, complained of having a difficult time with it, but ultimately succeeded. One of the art books
                revealed the Four-Tails to be a large, red gorilla. The beast manifests itself in Rōshi's hair. In the Shinobi World War Arc, he makes his debut, re-sealed inside an Edo-Tensei revived Rōshi. When Tobi makes Rōshi transform into the Four-Tails,
                it manages to catch Naruto in its teeth and swallow him whole. However, Naruto ends up in the Four-Tails's mental prison. The Four-Tails has a condescending view of all humans, believing they view the Tailed Beasts only as sources of power.
                He wishes to be referred to only as Son Goku, the name given to him by the Sage of Six Paths himself. Son reveals the Nine-Tails' true name: Kurama. When Naruto shows him kindness, he's intrigued that a human seriously wants to befriend
                him.

                One of the lesser-mentioned beasts and hosts, being one of the first jinchūriki to fall to Akatsuki. They were hardly mentioned until their official debut in the manga's Chapter 420 and Episode 205 of Shippuden. The most recent art book provided the fandom
                with a glimpse into their lives and the nature of their Tailed Beasts. The Five-Tails is a horse-dolphin hybrid that belonged to a very tall, grey-eyed man from the Hidden Rock Village covered in a strange suit of blood-red armor named
                Han, who used the power of his Tailed Beast to fight using steam. Han was subdued by Akatsuki and had the Five-Tails extracted from him, resulting in his death. In the Shinobi World War Arc, Han and the Five-Tails appear in the flesh for
                the first time, now under Tobi's control from a combination of Edo Tensei and the Six Paths of Pain. Tobi tries to force Han to transform into the Five-Tails, but the beast attempts to resist him, which the Eight-Tails discovers much to
                his chagrin. In extreme pain, it seems to be on the verge of begging for help. Displeased with the beast's resistance towards him, Tobi reverses Han's transformation and dials it back to a partial state.

            <p>
                This is a Tailed Beast that was formerly sealed in the Mist ninja Utakata. At some point in the past, Utakata's former master Harusame once tried unsuccessfully to extract Saiken from his body, killing Harusame in the process. Utakata had sworn not to
                use the Tailed Beast's powers ever again but is forced to do so to in the process of rescuing his student, Hotaru, from a man named Shiranami who had activated the destructive jutsu fused with her body. Soon after resolving this conflict,
                Utakata is found by all Six Paths of Pain, which quickly overwhelm and incapacitate him. Though it isn't shown, Saiken is extracted from his body by Akatsuki, and sealed into the Gedo Mazo. Kabuto later resurrects Utakata with Edo Tensei,
                and Saiken is resealed in its former jinchūriki, during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Interestingly the Six-Tails seems to have a decent relationship with Utakata; willingly giving Utakata access to his full Six-Tail form, presumably without
                resistance.

                This Tailed Beast, one of the final two still uncaptured by Akatsuki, is sealed into a ninja from the Hidden Cloud Village. The host appears to be on good terms with the spirit, as they can work together to break genjutsu, and even converse casually outside
                of battle. Its seal manifests itself in the tattoo of a Tetsu (Iron) kanji. One of its horns was lost in battle when it attacked the Hidden Cloud Village and gored Motoi's father in the process, causing his death. A retaliated by slicing
                the horn clean off, which has yet to grow back — and may never do so.

            <p>
                As a consequence of being sealed into the main character, this is the Tailed Beast with the most screen time. Kurama is widely believed to be the strongest of the nine, reputedly able to raise tsunamis and flatten mountains with just a single swipe of
                a tail. Prior to the series, it attacked the Hidden Leaf Village after Tobi extracted it from its then-host, Naruto's mother Kushina, who had just given birth to the kid. To stop it, the Fourth Hokage sealed it into the newborn Naruto
                (his son, as he was Kushina's husband) and himself, sacrificing his own life to do so while his Action Mom wife did the same. Tobi claims that its attack on the village was only out of its own accord, as Kurama has a fearsome reputation
                as a natural disaster that can desolate areas where the darkest aspects of human nature collect and fester. Kurama is cynical and shrewd, and expresses great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the Tailed Beasts
                due to having the most tails, which earned Kurama nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku. Ever since its sealing within Naruto, Kurama plotted to use the young shinobi's dependence on its power to break free from
                the seal, but as long as it remained sealed, it was a (however unwilling) ally of Naruto's. Usually, the fox manifests itself in whisker-shaped markings on Naruto's cheeks. It also grants him improved stamina and a Healing Factor. Naruto
                can also draw upon the fox's enormous reserves of chakra in order to make up for his own lack of chakra control. When Naruto becomes consumed by rage, he starts to draw further on the fox's chakra. When this happens, the "whiskers" on
                Naruto's face darken, his teeth become longer and sharper, his eyes turn red with slitted pupils, he begins moving about on all fours and he becomes covered in a coat of bubbling red chakra.note
            </p>
            <figure class="leftFloat">

            </figure>
            <p>
                At first, this happens unconsciously. After being trained by Jiraiya, however, Naruto learns how to actively demand chakra from the fox. To do so, he goes into the depths of his mind (depicted as a dripping sewer with a humongous cage containing the fox)
                and demands that the fox assist him with its chakra (or as Naruto euphemistically calls it, the fox's "rent"). The more Naruto gives in to his rage, "tails" of chakra begin to appear. He grows more powerful with each one that appears,
                but he also loses control of his own personality. When he reaches four tails, he enters the Version 2 state and the fox's personality becomes dominant. During the Invasion of the Leaf Village, Naruto has shown the six and eight-tailed
                forms. It's been theorized that if he ever made it up to nine, the seal would be broken and the fox would be freed. The seal also seems to be weakening over time. Jiraiya made an attempt to teach Naruto to retain control after four tails,
                but in so doing he came as close to death as he ever had. Instead, he settled for creating several seals which can suppress the fox's influence. Yamato's Tenth Edict on Enlightenment jutsu can do this job as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Sharingan has the ability to control the fox. In Shippuden, Sasuke prevented Naruto from drawing on its power, and it was later revealed that Madara Uchiha had "tamed" it and used it in his battle against the First Hokage. Itachi Uchiha was originally
                assigned to capture it, but with his death, Tobi sent Pain to do it instead. After that didn't work, Tobi decided to handle things himself. With the help of his parents, Naruto successfully bested the fox in combat and gained the ability
                to tap into the fox's massive chakra reserves whenever he chooses, giving himself a Super Saiyan-like glow in the process. Things progress even further when, upon seeing Naruto's genuine concern for its brethren, Kurama finally accepts
                its host as an equal partner, and the cage is finally unlocked. Now, Naruto is finally able to complete the Tailed Beast Transformation Technique, though his is unique in that it is translucent and glowing yellow. When Kurama's Yang half
                is extracted from Naruto he gets the Yin half. Once the Yang half is freed from the Ten-Tails, it is eventually sealed back inside Naruto.

                past, the Sage and his brother managed to defeat the Ten-Tails and harness its power to usher humanity into a new era. At the end of his life, the Sage split the Ten-Tails' chakra into the nine tailed beasts so that its power could never
                be used against the world again. Centuries later, its revival became the objective of Madara Uchiha and the Akatsuki. The world of ninja united in opposition of this ambition, resulting in the Fourth Shinobi World War.

            <p>What is Naruto?</p>
            <p>
                Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by Masashi Kishimoto. It was first published as a manga, in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in November, 1999. Since then, it has gone on to be one of the most successful and popular manga
                series in Japan and around the world. An anime adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on TV Tokyo, on October 3, 2002. A total of 220 episodes were made (though many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely
                popular and enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled "Naruto Shippuden", has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by Masashi Kishimoto.
