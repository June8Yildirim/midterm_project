        <h1>Tail Beasts and Their Hosts</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Stroy of Tail Beasts</h2>
            <p>
                Long before the founding of the hidden villages, the Sage of Six Paths saved the world by sealing the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki. Some time later, the Sage was inspired by his youngest son, Asura, to use his Creation of All Things
                ability to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine living entities, what would become the tailed beasts. The Sage named the nine and explained to them that a link existed between them despite their separation. The tailed beasts were originally
                created not only to prevent the Ten-Tails' resurrection, but also to maintain and balance peace. The first person to come close to their original usage was Hashirama Senju, who had captured several of the tailed beasts with his
                <strong>Wood Release</strong> , distributed the beasts amongst the new villages in order to stabilise the balance of power between them. However, <abbr title="First Hokage">Hashirama</abbr>'s usage of the tailed beasts were forceful rather
                than earning their wilful cooperation. This method would be realised in Hashirama's successor as
                <abbr title="Son of the Sage of Six Path">Asura</abbr>'s reincarnation, Naruto Uzumaki.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tailed beasts sharing their chakra with Naruto. Decades later, after the Third Shinobi World War, an organisation known as Akatsuki begins capturing the villages' jinchūriki in order to extract their tailed beasts and seal them into the
                <strong>Demonic Statue</strong> of the Outer Path for the purposes of reviving the Ten-Tails. By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Akatsuki has captured the first seven tailed beasts. In order to capture the last two, the Eight-Tails
                and Nine-Tails, Tobi seals the beasts back into their reincarnated jinchūriki and forces them to fight the Eight-Tails' and Nine-Tails' jinchūriki: Killer B and Naruto Uzumaki, respectively. From Naruto's determination to free them from
                Tobi and his desire to learn their names, the tailed beasts collectively decide that Naruto is the person the Sage of Six Paths foretold of. They give him portions of their chakra, enabling him to release them from Tobi's control.
                <cite><a href="workCited.html#thirtythree">[33]</a> </cite>
            </p>
            <figure class="totalBijuus">
                <img src="bijus/bijuus.jpg" alt="All Bijuus" />
            </figure>
            <p>
                The tailed beasts reunite with Hagoromo and Naruto. Tobi is able to reclaim the freed tailed beasts and, using fragments of the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails' chakra, to prematurely revive the Ten-Tails. Tobi then becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, but he
                is defeated by the <s>Allied Shinobi</s> Forces and the tailed beasts are removed from his body. The nine tailed beasts join forces against Tobi's co-conspirator, Madara Uchiha, but he quickly defeats them all and seals
                them, including the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, into the Demonic Statue and reforms the Ten-Tails yet again. Madara becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki and attempts to use
                <strong><em>Infinite Tsukuyomi </em></strong> on the world. Naruto uses the tailed beasts' earlier donations of chakra to try and defeat him, but is unable to do so in time. Madara is afterwards unwittingly used to restore <strong>Kaguya Ōtsutsuki,</strong>                who tries to take what portions of the tailed beasts' chakra Naruto still has. The nine tailed beasts being freed from the Ten-Tails. In one of Kaguya's dimensions, Naruto and Sasuke Uchiha seal Kaguya away and the tailed beasts are extracted
                from her body, ending the war. Sasuke, however, realising that the struggle for the tailed beasts started the war in the first place, imprisons them with Chibaku Tensei and intends to kill them so the world can't fight over them any longer.
                Naruto convinces him not to in the end and the tailed beasts are finally released for good. The tailed beasts spread out through the world, free to live as they want; both Gyūki and Kurama decide to return and stay with B and Naruto. However,
                though they are apart, the tailed beasts' chakra fragments remain within Naruto, allowing his body to act as their <em>"meeting ground".</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>

            <p>
                The tailed beasts performing their signature technique. Tailed beasts are widely believed to be bestial in nature, incapable of the intelligence needed to fully utilise their immense strength. It is thought that only when sealed within humans are they
                able to benefit from the knowledge of their jinchūriki to use their powers effectively.
                <span class="underline"><strong>This is not actually true</strong> .</span
          >
          However, the Ten-Tails does tend to make wanton use of its powers, not
          focusing its abilities towards whatever end would be most advantageous
          to it until sealed into a jinchūriki.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tailed beasts can communicate
          <strong>telepathically with one another and their jinchūriki</strong>
          , and possess several levels of consciousness. In the initial level,
          the beast appears to be in a habitat of sorts, typically imprisoned in
          some way by whatever fūinjutsu was used to seal them. The second level
          is where all the tailed beasts can convene and communicate with one
          another, free of any restrictions. Jinchūriki are also able to enter
          this level, but in order to do so, they must be completely linked with
          their tailed beasts. A freed tailed beast can continue communication
          with their former jinchūriki, even years after separating.

          Host:
          <a href="../index.html#gaara">Gaara</a>
        </h3>
        <figure class="rightFloat">
          <img src="bijus/oneTail.jpg" alt="Shukaku" />
          <figcaption>One-Tail</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The only Tailed Beast to be referred to by actual name instead of just
          referred to by what animal it looks like or its number of tails, at
          least, up until Chapter 568. According to the <u> (untrue)</u> legends
          of the Hidden Sand Village, Shukaku was once a man, a corrupted monk
          who was sealed into a tea kettle. It was sealed into Gaara upon his
          birth by Chiyo on orders from the Fourth Kazekage, using Gaara's
          mother as a sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Gaara's sullen, morose personality, Shukaku is childish
          and short-tempered, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent
          manner, giving it the demeanor of a drunkard
          <em>
            (this fits in with typical depictions of tanuki in Japanese
            mythology)</em
          >
          . Like all Tailed Beasts, it has an immense blood-lust and hunger for
          battle and relishes a chance to kill opponents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shukaku has the ability to levitate sand via the
          <strong>Magnet Release</strong>
          <em>(which normally only affects metals such as iron and gold)</em> ,
          which allows its host to manipulate it for both offense and defense,
          doing the latter to automatically protect
          <abbr title="its previous hosts">Gaara</abbr> from all harm. This
          prevents even self-inflicted injuries — Gaara had never known physical
          pain before the series. Gaara's famed sand shield is even long thought
          to be Shukaku's doing until it gets extracted from Gaara yet the
          latter still exhibits his power. Unlike other Tailed Beasts, whose
          transformations are formed of red chakra, Shukaku's hosts transform by
          covering themselves in sand. When angry or consumed by bloodlust,
          Gaara can give himself over to Shukaku, allowing the spirit to take
          its true form. In this form, it is so large that Naruto was forced to
          summon Gamabunta in order to defeat him.
          <strong>Shukaku is associated with the Wind </strong> element.

        <p>
          This Tailed Beast was sealed into <strong>Yugito Nii</strong>, a
          kunoichi of the Hidden Cloud Village. It is said to be a spirit of
          vengeance — the living ghost of a twisted human being. It can breathe
          fire. Yugito can transform into Matatabi, but this didn't help her
          against <em>Hidan and Kakuzu</em>, who defeated her in a battle with
          massive collateral damage. The spirit was later extracted, and Yugito
          died from the procedure. <u>Yugito and Matatabi</u> returned in the
          Fourth Shinobi World War Arc alongside the other jinchūriki, brought
          back to life under the control of Edo Tensei, with the cat resealed
          inside her. Killer B expressed his distaste when he saw one of his old
          role models being used as a chew toy.

          This giant turtle-like monster is the only Tailed Beast seen so far
          who was not sealed into a host when Akatsuki captured it. However, the
          Beast has had at least two hosts at one point,
          <strong> Rin Nohara </strong>of Konoha, made a jinchūriki in order to
          destroy Konoha; and a young man from the Hidden Mist Village named
          <strong>Yagura Karatachi</strong>, who was the Fourth Mizukage.
          However,
          <u>Yagura was mind-controlled by Tobi and killed afterward </u>, so
          the Beast was free by the time it was encountered in the main story. A
          Filler arc was centered around this creature, with the Leaf Ninja
          trying to seal it, only to be stopped by Guren and her henchmen
          repeatedly, eventually foiling the mission altogether. As such, the
          Akatsuki tracked it down, where it was easily defeated by

          This Beast, referred as the Four-Tails, was sealed into the body of
          <strong>Rōshi</strong>, an elderly man from the
          <strong>Hidden Rock Village.</strong> His host was able to manipulate
          <em>lava</em> , likely a power gained from this beast. Rather than
          letting its presence cause him scorn and hate, Rōshi left his village
          to try and better understand the beast. However, Rōshi would
          eventually run into
          <strong
            ><a href="../Akatsuki/akatsuki.html">Kisame Hoshigaki</a></strong
          >
          of the Akatsuki and engaged in a lengthy battle with the shark ninja.
          Unfortunately, although he was a very tough opponent, Rōshi was
          defeated, and later died when the Four-Tails was forcibly extracted
          from his body. Kisame, who was assigned to capture it, complained of
          having a difficult time with it, but ultimately succeeded. One of the
          art books revealed the Four-Tails to be a large, red gorilla. The
          beast manifests itself in Rōshi's hair. In the Shinobi World War Arc,
          he makes his debut, re-sealed inside an Edo-Tensei revived Rōshi. When
          Tobi makes Rōshi transform into the Four-Tails, it manages to catch
          Naruto in its teeth and swallow him whole. However, Naruto ends up in
          the Four-Tails's mental prison. The Four-Tails has a condescending
          view of all humans, believing they view the Tailed Beasts only as
          sources of power. He wishes to be referred to only as Son Goku, the
          name given to him by the Sage of Six Paths himself. Son reveals the
          Nine-Tails' true name: Kurama. When Naruto shows him kindness, he's
          intrigued that a human seriously wants to befriend him.

          One of the lesser-mentioned beasts and hosts, being one of the first
          jinchūriki to fall to Akatsuki. The most recent art book provided the
          fandom with a glimpse into their lives and the nature of their Tailed
          Beasts. The Five-Tails is a horse-dolphin hybrid that belonged to a
          very tall, grey-eyed man from the
          <strong>Hidden Rock Village</strong> covered in a strange suit of
          blood-red armor named <strong>Han</strong>, who used the power of his
          Tailed Beast to fight using steam. Han was subdued by Akatsuki and had
          the Five-Tails extracted from him, resulting in his death. In the
          Shinobi World War Arc, Han and the Five-Tails appear in the flesh for
          the first time, now under Tobi's control from a combination of Edo
          Tensei and the Six Paths of Pain. Tobi tries to force Han to transform
          into the Five-Tails, but the beast attempts to resist him, which the
          Eight-Tails discovers much to his chagrin. In extreme pain, it seems
          to be on the verge of begging for help. Displeased with the beast's
          resistance towards him, Tobi reverses Han's transformation and dials
          it back to a partial state.

          This is a Tailed Beast that was formerly sealed in the Mist ninja
          Utakata. At some point in the past, <strong> Utakata</strong>'s former
          master Harusame once tried unsuccessfully to extract Saiken from his
          body, killing <i>Harusame</i> in the process. Utakata had sworn not to
          use the Tailed Beast's powers ever again but is forced to do so to in
          the process of rescuing his student, Hotaru, from a man named
          Shiranami who had activated the destructive jutsu fused with her body.
          Soon after resolving this conflict, Utakata is found by all Six Paths
          of Pain, which quickly overwhelm and incapacitate him. Though it isn't
          shown, Saiken is extracted from his body by Akatsuki, and sealed into
          the <strong>Gedo Mazo</strong>. Kabuto later resurrects Utakata with
          Edo Tensei, and Saiken is resealed in its former jinchūriki, during
          the Fourth Shinobi World War. Interestingly the Six-Tails seems to
          have a decent relationship with Utakata; willingly giving Utakata
          access to his full Six-Tail form, presumably without resistance.

          This Tailed Beast, one of the final two still uncaptured by Akatsuki,
          is sealed into a ninja from the
          <strong> Hidden Cloud Village</strong>. The host appears to be on good
          terms with the spirit, as they can work together to break genjutsu,
          and even converse casually outside of battle. Its seal manifests
          itself in the tattoo of a Tetsu (Iron) kanji. One of its horns was
          lost in battle when it attacked the Hidden Cloud Village and gored
          Motoi's father in the process, causing his death. A retaliated by
          slicing the horn clean off, which has yet to grow back — and may never
          do so.

          As a consequence of being sealed into the main character, this is the
          Tailed Beast with the most screen time. Kurama is widely believed to
          be the strongest of the nine, reputedly able to raise tsunamis and
          flatten mountains with just a single swipe of a tail. Prior to the
          series, it attacked the Hidden Leaf Village after Tobi extracted it
          from its then-host, <strong>Naruto's mother Kushina,</strong> who had
          just given birth to the kid. To stop it, the Fourth Hokage sealed it
          into the newborn
          <abbr title="His son, as he was Kushina's husband">Naruto</abbr> and
          himself, sacrificing his own life to do so while his action Mom wife
          did the same. Tobi claims that its attack on the village was only out
          of its own accord, as Kurama has a fearsome reputation as a natural
          disaster that can desolate areas where the darkest aspects of human
          nature collect and fester. Kurama is cynical and shrewd, and expresses
          great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the
          Tailed Beasts due to having the most tails, which earned Kurama
          nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku. Ever
          since its sealing within Naruto,
          <u
            >Kurama plotted to use the young shinobi's dependence on its power
            to break free from the seal, but as long as it remained sealed, it
            was a <b> (however unwilling)</b> ally of Naruto's</u
          >
          . Usually, the fox manifests itself in whisker-shaped markings on
          Naruto's cheeks. It also grants him
          <em>improved stamina and a Healing Factor</em> . Naruto can also draw
          upon the fox's enormous reserves of chakra in order to make up for his
          own lack of chakra control. When Naruto becomes consumed by rage, he
          starts to draw further on the fox's chakra. When this happens, the
          "whiskers" on Naruto's face darken, his teeth become longer and
          sharper, his eyes turn red with slitted pupils, he begins moving about
          on all fours and he becomes covered in a coat of bubbling red chakra
          note
        </p>

        <p>
          At first, this happens unconsciously. After being trained by
          <strong>Jiraiya</strong>, however, Naruto learns how to actively
          demand chakra from the fox. The more Naruto gives in to his
          <b>rage,</b> "tails" of chakra begin to appear. He grows more powerful
          with each one that appears, but
          <em> he also loses control of his own personality</em>. When he
          reaches <strong> four tails</strong>, he enters the
          <em> Version 2 state</em> and the fox's personality becomes dominant.
          During the Invasion of the Leaf Village, Naruto has shown the six and
          eight-tailed forms. It's been theorized that if he ever made it up to
          nine, the seal would be broken and the fox would be freed. The seal
          also seems to be weakening over time. Jiraiya made an attempt to teach
          Naruto to retain control after four tails, but in so doing he came as
          close to death as he ever had. Instead,
          <i>
            he settled for creating several seals which can suppress the fox's
            influence. Yamato's Tenth Edict on Enlightenment jutsu can do this
            job as well.</i
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The Sharingan has the ability to control the fox. In Shippuden, Sasuke
          prevented Naruto from drawing on its power, and it was later revealed
          that <a href="../Akatsuki/akatsuki.html">Madara Uchiha</a> had
          <strong>"tamed"</strong> it and used it in his battle against the
          First Hokage. Itachi Uchiha was originally assigned to capture it, but
          with his death, Tobi sent Pain to do it instead. After that didn't
          work, Tobi decided to handle things himself. With the help of his
          parents, Naruto successfully bested the fox in combat and gained the
          ability to tap into the fox's massive chakra reserves whenever he
          chooses, giving himself a Super Saiyan-like glow in the process.
          Things progress even further when, upon seeing Naruto's genuine
          concern for its brethren, <strong>Kurama</strong> finally accepts its
          host as an equal partner, and the cage is finally unlocked. Now,
          Naruto is finally able to complete the
          <u>Tailed Beast Transformation Technique</u> , though his is unique in
          that it is translucent and glowing yellow. When Kurama's Yang half is
          extracted from Naruto he gets the Yin half. Once the Yang half is
          freed from the Ten-Tails, it is eventually sealed back inside Naruto.

          his brother managed to defeat the Ten-Tails and harness its power to
          usher humanity into a new era. At the end of his life, the Sage split
          the Ten-Tails' chakra into the nine tailed beasts so that its power
          could never be used against the world again. Centuries later, its
          revival became the objective of
          <strong> Madara Uchiha and the Akatsuki</strong>. The world of ninja
          united in opposition of this ambition, resulting in the Fourth Shinobi

        <p>What is Naruto?</p>
        <p>
          Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by
          <em> Masashi Kishimoto</em>. It was first published as a manga, in the
          Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in <u> November, 1999</u>. Since
          then, it has gone on to be one of the <b> most successful</b> and
          popular manga series in Japan and around the world. An anime
          adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on TV
          Tokyo, on October 3, 2002. A total of 220 episodes were made (though
          many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely popular and
          enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled "Naruto
          Shippuden", has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime
          follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by
          Masashi Kishimoto.
