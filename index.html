        <h1>Naruto's World</h1>
        <h2>General info </h2>
        <div>
            Naruto is a Shonen (teen male oriented) animated series and manga (Japanese comic) created by Masashi Kishimoto. Both the anime and the manga are ongoing in Japan at the moment. The series has been licensed abroad in various countries. You can find Naruto
            manga on American shelves and the animated series airing in the Philippines. The show takes place in a world populated by ninja villages. The ninja in the series serve as the armies for the countries that inhabit the world. Most of the countries
            have their own Hidden Village, which serves to train and manage the ninja of the country. Also the ninja in the series are able to utilize jutsu techniques, which are the secrecy, body and illusion arts of the ninja. These allow the ninja
            to perform many amazing skills such as the manipulation of the surrounding elements. The main character of the series is Uzumaki Naruto, a young boy who dreams of becoming the leader of his Hidden Village. It will be difficult though for Naruto,
            because when he was a baby an evil demon was placed inside him to stop its rampage. As Naruto grew the townspeople saw Naruto himself as the demon, even though he was merely its container. When the series begins the reader and viewer will
            begin their journey with Naruto on his path to become respected by the village.

                    Hokagenote of Konoha. When he was just an infant, the Fourth Hokage sealed the evil Nine-Tailed Fox demon inside his body. He goes from being viewed as nothing but the demon itself to a full-fledged ninja once he saves his sensei Iruka
                    from the evil Mizuki. He gradually matures from his Idiot Hero demeanor over the course of the series, and by the time Shippuden rolls in, he's older and wiser, not to mention stronger than ever.

                        Over the course of the series, Jiraiya's teachings and his interaction with Nagato/Pain influences Naruto into noting the futility of revenge and how hatred can ultimately destroy everything a person holds dear, thus driving Naruto's need to save Sasuke
                        from himself even more. Another result of saving Konoha from Pain's attack finally turned the villager's hatred into admiration and respect at long last. Naruto also does the impossible and finally befriends the tailed beast sealed
                        within himself, as well as the other tailed beasts, undergoing a massive power-up. Along with Sasuke and aid from the spirit of the Sage of the Six Paths, Naruto finally succeeds in redeeming Obito, stopping Madara and putting
                        an end to Kaguya's ambitions. He then performs another miracle and finally redeems Sasuke by the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                        achieves his dream of becoming Hokage by becoming the Seventh after Kakashi steps down. The Sequel Series, Boruto and its original film version explore his life as Hokage and the relationship between him and his son, Boruto.

                <p>Sasuke Uchiha is Naruto's rival and The Lancer of Team 7, a prodigy who possesses the power copying Sharingan bloodline limit; he is also the father of Sarada Uchiha in Boruto. He's one of the last remaining members of the Clan, who were
                    mostly murdered by his Aloof Big Brother Itachi in a single night. Since the incident, Sasuke focused himself to acquire enough power to kill Itachi and avenge the clan. Initially a loner and so-not-a-team player, Sasuke develops a
                    grudging respect for Naruto. He eventually grows jealous of the possibility of Naruto outshining him, and abandons Konoha and heads off to join Orochimaru, who desired his Sharingan. Not even an epic battle with Naruto could change
                    his mind.</p>

                        In Shippuden, he returns, stronger than ever, and now knows of the Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto. He disposes of Orochimaru, forms a team of the latter's old captives and associates, calling the team "Snake" (Hebi), and finally faces his brother in battle.
                        However, Tobi, the true leader of Akatsuki, reveals the tragic truth behind the Uchiha Massacre and that the object of his revenge was just as much a victim as Sasuke was. To that end, Sasuke renames his team "Hawk" (Taka) and
                        changes his revenge to wiping out the village of Konoha. Along the way on this new path, Sasuke becomes much darker and ends up having a bounty be placed on his own head for trying to assassinate the man who orchestrated the massacre
                        in the first place, Danzo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He finally succeeds in killing Danzo but his newfound hatred overwhelms him, alienating even his most devoted followers, (Karin, Konoha 12, Kakashi, etc.) leaving only Naruto as the one person who still wants to save Sasuke. Later Sasuke takes Itachi's
                        eyes in order to save himself from blindness and obtain new powers. Through fate and chance, Sasuke once again meets up with his brother Itachi, brought back by Edo Tensei, and together they manage to stop the caster of the technique,
                        though not before Itachi manages to change Sasuke's mindset from mindless revenge and get him to start thinking for himself instead of always allowing himself to be influenced by others. He also apologizes for the pain he put his
                        little brother through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reviving Orochimaru and enlisting his help in bringing back the four original Hokages, Sasuke learns of the origins of the village and resolves to protect the legacy his brother left behind by becoming the next Hokage. To this end, Sasuke leaves
                        for the battlefield to face off against Madara and the Ten-Tails. Through many hardships, Sasuke gains half the power of the Sage of the Six Paths and helps Naruto in the fight with villains. It is then that Sasuke reveals his
                        plans of bringing about "revolution" by murdering the five Kage and taking on all the world's hatred for himself, thereby uniting the villages and the world through fear and anger; his definition of being "Hokage". Naruto notes
                        the stupidity of this idea, stating that he learned nothing from Itachi and resolves to end their feud once and for all
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately Naruto wins their final clash and finally redeems Sasuke, causing him to let go of all his hatred. As penance for his actions, he resolves to travel the world to prevent another incident from happening again. Along the way, he also returns
                        Sakura's feelings, get married and together they have one daughter, Sarada Uchiha. Later Sasuke becomes the personal teacher of his rival's son, Boruto.

                    The Chick of Team 7. For most of the series Naruto has a comical unrequited crush on her, but she acts dismissive towards him while she's in love with Sasuke; However, over the course of the series she grows to appreciate and care for Naruto as a friend
                    and teammate in great part due to their shared bond with Sasuke. She would eventually become Sasuke Uchiha's wife and the mother of Sarada Uchiha in Boruto. Sakura herself is an intelligent, gifted kunoichi from Konoha. Unlike most
                    other ninja in the series, she has no unique skills of her own, using only standard ninja techniques and her brains. As a result, during Part I, she mostly sits on the sidelines. After failing to prevent her only love, Sasuke's defection,
                    and seeing a badly injured Naruto in the hospital, she concludes that she can't leave things like this, and apprentices herself to Princes Tsunade with the intent of no longer being a burden and help bringing Sasuke back

                        In Part II, Sakura has picked up Super Strength and medical skills courtesy of Tsunade's Training from Hell, which turns her from The Load to a fine kunoichi of her calibre. Her growth is shown in the first major fight of the new series, joining forces
                        with Chiyo to help defeat Akatsuki member Sasori in a drawn-out battle, and her healing skills are put to use for much of the series.

                        From then on, Sakura's focus and presence in the story Zig Zags in importance, though the two constants that remain throughout are her unwavering love for Sasuke and her platonic friendship with Naruto. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, she unlocks
                        her full potential with the White Strength Seal and like her teacher Tsunade, gains a permanent mark on her forehead signifying mastery, although for the most part she is still relegated to being The Medic. Even though she participates
                        in the final battle against Kaguya, Naruto and Sasuke still do all the fighting while she serves as a distraction, and she realizes that she Can't Catch Up to them after all. By the story's end, her love for Sasuke is finally realized
                        and reciprocated; they marry after he is redeemed by Naruto and have one daughter together, Sarada Uchiha.

                        Kakashi, for reasons that are at first unknown, has a Sharingan in his left eye, despite not being of the Uchiha (In a Gaiden prequel story, the eye was revealed to have been transplanted from his deceased friend Obito Uchiha, one of Sasuke's relatives).
                        Kakashi has mastered its use about as well as a non-Uchiha can, picking up the epithet "Copy Ninja." He knows dozens of techniques, and has even unlocked a Mangekyo Sharingan that differs from Itachi, although using it puts enormous
                        strain on his body. His only unique jutsu is the Chidori (and its upgraded form, Raikiri), a technique that consists of covering one of his full hands in his lightning-natured chakra, which allows him to cut/stab any target with
                        a single blow.

                        In Shippuden, Naruto and Sakura's development causes Kakashi to serve less as a mentor and more as a comrade. He still teaches Naruto, though, eventually helping him create a more powerful variant of the Rasengan.

                        Hokage and uses his new influence to pardon Sasuke of all his crimes. Two years later, despite losing his Sharingan, Kakashi proves himself a great leader by helping citizens on earth stay alive during the course of the movie.

                    Uchiha Itachi is an S-Level criminal and a Konoha Missing-nin. He graduated at the top of his Academy class at 7, had mastered the Sharingan by age 8, became a Chuunin at 10 and was previously a Black Ops (ANBU in the Japanese versions) captain at the
                    age of only 13. At 18, he was even feared by Orochimaru. He left Konoha some years ago, after killing his whole clan except for Uchiha Sasuke, his brother. He is currently associated with Akatsuki. Orochimaru had planned to use Itachi's
                    body as a new container, but seeing as Itachi is powerful to such a degree that even Orochimaru fears him, it's easy to see why Orochimaru decided to leave Akatsuki and try his luck with Sasuke instead.

                        The reason Itachi killed his clan, and the reason he left Sasuke alive only to physically and mentally abuse him, still remains a mystery. When asked why by Sasuke, he replied "To see what I am capable of." He was until recently the sole person who possessed
                        the Mangekyō Sharingan as revealed in the manga. Hatake Kakashi has somehow developed a new kind of Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga. Kakashi's Mangekyō Sharingan appears different compared to Itachi's, and the similarity in power
                        of both Mangekyō Sharingan is still unknown. Itachi has told Sasuke that if Sasuke were to obtain the Mangekyō Sharingan, the people able to use it will total at three. It is unknown whom the third person Itachi is referring to.

                    The former heiress of the Hyuga clan, later known as the "Byakugan Princess", she would eventually become the wife of Naruto Uzumaki and the mother of Boruto and Himawari Uzumaki. At first, she played the Shrinking Violet role of the main cast, being
                    completely weak and non-confrontational. Perhaps her most notable trait is her huge crush on Naruto, who is completely oblivious about it. However, it's this admiration that spurs her on to become stronger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hinata was born into the head family of the Hyuga clan and was expected to one day take it over. Since she started out extremely weak, this did not sit well with many others (namely Neji and her own father, Hiashi, though other extremely complicated reasons
                    made it even worse for her). With the involvement of Kurenai and the aforementioned admiration of Naruto, she gradually develops as a warrior, becoming more confident.

                    <p> Hinata, like all members of the Hyuga clan, has the kekkai genkai known as the Byakugan, characterized by the Prophet Eyes of its owners. It grants the user nearly-360-degree vision, as well as the ability to sense the flow of chakra
                        in the human body. Hinata uses the Gentle Fist style of martial arts, a special combat style designed to take advantage of the Byakugan's unique abilities.

                    <p>
                        In Part II, she goes out with Team Kakashi to search for Sasuke or Itachi, but that ends in failure when Itachi dies and Tobi takes Sasuke away. In Pain's invasion, she intervenes to save Naruto from Pain and finally tells him that she loves him. Pain
                        defeats her and nearly kills her, triggering Naruto going into six-tailed mode, but she survives with Sakura's help. When the Shinobi Alliance marches against Madara, she is placed in the Second Division alongside her cousin Neji,
                        Karui, and Kurotsuchi.

                        During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata's popularity and importance in the story increased significantly: she was able to snap Naruto out of his Heroic BSoD after the tragic death of her cousin Neji and inspires him to fight on. Later she and Naruto
                        become the main stars of the canon movie The Last: Naruto the Movie, where their love for each other is fully explored and finally realized, ending with them marrying and having two beautiful children, Boruto and Himawari Uzumaki.
                        She appears again as a loving and dedicated mother in her son's series, Boruto, and its movie version.

                    Neji is hailed as one of the foremost prodigies of his time — indeed, he is perhaps the greatest practitioner of the Hyuga's fighting style that there is. If he weren't a member of the branch family, he'd probably be heading up the clan someday. However,
                    his pedigree combined with his knowledge of past events fills him with a seething hatred of the main family.

                        In the Hyuga clan, there is a branch family and a main family. The branch family exists to serve the main family and tend to their needs. When a branch member is young, a seal is placed on their forehead to keep them from trying to kill the main family
                        (also, it will prevent any foreign ninja from operating on their body and learning the Byakugan's secrets).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Neji was young, his uncle Hiashi — Hinata's father — killed an intruder who aimed to capture Hinata. Since said intruder had some prestige in his home country, said country began calling for the head of his killer. The uncle was certain that they
                        would attempt to steal the Byakugan's secret, but Neji's father Hizashi went in his place — first, since he had the seal, and second, to defy his clan's tradition and fight against his fate. Neji didn't know about the last part
                        for a long time, though, and for years he resented everyone in the Hyuga clan. Neji's life experience, at first, makes him something of a Straw Nihilist, as he constantly mentions that fighting fate is useless. Interestingly enough,
                        this doesn't stop him from fighting his fate. He clobbers his cousin Hinata in the Chunin Exams, and is matched against Naruto in the first round of the finals. While he expects an easy win, Naruto quickly proves more resilient
                        than he thought, ultimately defeating him. After Naruto's victory, he convinces Neji that fate can successfully be fought, marking a positive change in his character. He later shows up in the Sasuke Recovery Mission arc, as part
                        of the team led by Shikamaru. He engages Kidomaru of the Sound Four, who fights him using ranged attacks. He takes some serious, life-threatening damage in the process, but he manages to win.

                        Neji is a close-range specialist. He uses the Byakugan, which gives the user nearly-360-degree vision and the ability to see the flow of chakra in the human body, to hit pressure points, blocking off his opponent's access to their chakra. He can also
                        create an impenetrable shield of chakra by rotating quickly; this is normally a technique reserved for the main house, but Neji reverse-engineered it.

                        In Part II, he is the only member of the Konoha 11 to become a Jonin. He later tags along with his team to back up Team Kakashi in the Kazekage Rescue Mission arc. In the Fourth Shinobi World War, he is part of the Second Division, considered to be the
                        Shinobi Alliance's up-close fighting division, along with Hinata, Karui, and Kurotsuchi. Tragically, Neji loses his life during the war in trying to protect Naruto and Hinata but he dies understanding why his father did what he
                        did and ultimately becomes a martyr for the Shinobi alliance in not giving up. His name goes on to influence the naming of Naruto and Hinata's first child, Boruto, with his grave being visited occasionally by the Uzumaki family.

                <p>Gaara of the Sand Waterfall is a young shinobi from the Hidden Sand Village who makes his first appearance in the Chunin Exam arc as Naruto's Evil Counterpart. Like Naruto, Gaara had a Tailed Beast, the maniacal sand spirit Shukaku, sealed
                    in him by his father, the Fourth Kazekage, before he was even born. The Kazekage's intent was for him to become a weapon for the village, but after several years declared the experiment a failure and repeatedly tried to have the child
                    assassinated. However, Shukaku's power protected Gaara from all harm. Gaara eventually grew to enjoy killing the assassins his father sent after him, reasoning that only through killing could he validate his own existence.

                        Gaara speaks in a dull monotone at all times except when he's in a killing frenzy. (This is later explained by the fact that Shukaku eats away at his consciousness when he sleeps, so he's become a chronic insomniac.) Even after his Heel–Face Turn, he
                        is quiet, creepy, and not very social.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the Invasion of Konoha arc, Gaara faces off against Naruto, who beats him with The Power of Friendship. The battle causes Gaara to reconsider his philosophy. He vows to protect the ones close to him rather than attempt to destroy them, and
                        makes it his goal to win the trust and admiration of his village. Gaara feels indebted to Naruto for the insight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Shippuden, Gaara has become the Fifth Kazekage. The first major arc of the new series revolves around him, as he is defeated and captured by the Akatsuki, who attempt to extract Shukaku from his body as part of their mission to collect all nine Tailed
                        Beasts. The reformed Team 7, as well as Team Guy and Chiyo of the Sand Village, mount a rescue mission. The Akatsuki manages to delay the rescuers long enough to extract the spirit, killing its host; however, Chiyo sacrifices her
                        own life to revive him. It's unknown to what degree, if any, his abilities were affected. After attending the meetings of the Kages called by the Raikage, he is appointed as the Regimental Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces,
                        and also commands the 4th/Long-Ranged-Battle Division. Fortunately, he still possesses enough power to be compared with Shukaku itself.

                    <p>
                        Throughout the war, Gaara has proven himself to be worthy of the Kazekage name and then some, first by defeating and reconciling with his father, the previous Kazekage, and then taking down Gengetsu Hozuki, the Second Mizukage. He goes on to fight Madara
                        Uchiha with the other four Kage but fail despite their best efforts. After getting a second wind, Gaara rushes where Naruto is confronting the Ten-Tails and Madara, being instrumental in keeping Naruto alive and safe throughout
                        the rest of the war.<a href="">Read Less</a>

        <h2> Jutsu Guide </h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                In the world of Naruto, a jutsu ("Technique" or "Skill" in Japanese) is a general term referring to any technique a ninja might use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jutsu are usually the product of channeling chakra to a certain part or parts of the body (through the inner coil system, which is to chakra as blood vessels are to blood) and then manipulating it to create an effect which wouldn't be possible otherwise.
                If the inner coil system malfunctions or is blocked in any way, it is impossible to perform any jutsu at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, jutsu are divided into three categories: Taijutsu (Body techniques), Genjutsu (Mind techniques) and Ninjutsu (Techniques that rely on sources beyond those). Besides these main categories there is another, more specific category: Fūin
                jutsu (Sealing techniques). Besides being either Ninjutsu, Taijutsu or Genjutsu a jutsu can also be "Hiden" ( Secret). Hiden jutsu are jutsu passed down from generation to generation within some clans.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also Kekkei genkai. These are not really jutsu, but special, genetically inherited abilities like the ability to copy other jutsu or to merge your body with other bodies. Kekkei genkai abilities that work via the user's eye are called Dojutsu
                (Pupil Techniques). Some jutsu are based on Kekkei Genkai, like Tsukuyomi.
            </p>

        <h2> Keke-genkai (Bloodline) </h2>
        <figure class="position">

        <div>
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> Kekkei genkai typically come in the form of dōjutsu or combined nature transformations. Dōjutsu are abilities concentrated in the eye, and combined nature transformations are ninjutsu that utilize two nature transformations. Ninjutsu that
                utilize three nature transformations are likewise referred to as kekkei tota.
            </p>

            <p> Compared to dōjutsu which are almost exclusively passed down through clans, nature transformation kekkei genkai seem to appear in individuals with no known relation. Lava Release, a combination of fire and earth-based chakra, has appeared
                in ninja from Kirigakure, Iwagakure, and Kumogakure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Kekkei Genkai require the genetic prerequisite to form these abilities, they are unable to be copied by others. However, there have been attempts to gain the unique abilities of kekkei genkai through transplantation and genetic experimentation.
                Dōjutsu can be transplanted into the body of another person, like with Ao and his Byakugan or Kakashi and his Sharingan. As a downside, activating and using a dōjutsu you didn't naturally develop requires much more chakra usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chakra elements can also be passed down to people outside of the clan, such as Yamato being subjected to DNA re-modification by Orochimaru who wanted to acquire Wood Release. However, Yamato's skill in using it is not nearly as powerful as the originator
                Hashirama Senju, and the risk of such process was that Yamato was the only one of the sixty test subjects to survive.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Dojutsu</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sharingan</dt>
            <dd>The Sharingan is the dōjutsu kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan that appears selectively among its members. It is regarded as one of the "Three Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Byakugan and the Rinnegan.</dd>
            <dt>Mangekyō Sharingan</dt>
            <dd>The Mangekyō Sharingan is distinguished from a normal Sharingan by its appearance, which changes the form of the tomoe seal. The exact design differs for each user, though all resemble pinwheels. It is initially awakened by the trauma suffered
                from witnessing the death of someone close to the user. Uchiha have historically misunderstood this criteria as the user needing to be responsible for the person's death, and for that reason they developed the practice of killing their
                closest friends in order to gain the Mangekyō Sharingan.
            </dd>
            <dt>Byakugan</dt>
            <dd>The Byakugan is the dōjutsu kekkei genkai of the Hyūga and Ōtsutsuki clans, inherited from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. It is regarded as one of the "Three Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Sharingan and the Rinnegan.
            </dd>
            <dt>Rinnegan</dt>
            <dd>
                The Rinnegan is reputed as the most exalted eye amongst the "Three Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Sharingan and the Byakugan. It is said that in times of disorder, one who wields the Rinnegan is sent down from the heavens to become either a "God
                of Creation" who will calm the world or a "God of Destruction" who will reduce everything to nothingness. The Rinnegan is characterised by a ripple pattern that spreads over the eyeball.

            <p>What is Naruto?</p>
            <p>
                Naruto is a Japanese anime and manga series, created by Masashi Kishimoto. It was first published as a manga, in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shonen Jump, in November, 1999. Since then, it has gone on to be one of the most successful and popular manga
                series in Japan and around the world. An anime adaptation of the series has also been made, first debuting on TV Tokyo, on October 3, 2002. A total of 220 episodes were made (though many of them were fillers). The anime series was hugely
                popular and enjoyed a lot of success in Japan, and a new series, entitled "Naruto Shippuden", has since been created, and is still ongoing. The anime follows the storyline of the manga, which is still being produced by Masashi Kishimoto.
